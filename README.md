AQI Prediction using Machine Learning

This project focuses on predicting the Air Quality Index (AQI) using various environmental and pollutant features through machine learning techniques.

Project Objective
To build a model that accurately predicts AQI based on input features like PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, CO, O3, etc., helping in air quality monitoring and early warning systems.

Tools & Libraries Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)

Machine Learning Models
- Decision Tree Regressor
- Random Forest Regressor
- Model evaluation using MAE and RÂ² score

Key Features
- Data preprocessing & feature selection
- AQI prediction for unseen data
- Model comparison and visualization

Insights
- Found which pollutants affect AQI most
- Achieved high accuracy with Random Forest Regressor
